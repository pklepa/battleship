## Objectives & Outcomes

Even though this project has a rather clear desired outcome as declared by its scope (recreation of Battleship game), my main focus whilst in development is to try my hand at the modern and, quite frankly, necessary philosophy of **Test Driven Development** as it improves the overall design of the code, encourages refactoring, reduces bugs both in new and in existing features and so much more.

In summary, the objectives are:

- Practice the concept of **Test Driven Development** in a relatively large project.

- Write Unit Tests for most of the business logic using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

- Improve code design and preparation in writing tests _before_ the actual code.

Also, other soft skills were healthly improved in this project:

- Further improve React proficiency in functional components using Hooks.

- Familiarize with Jest's documentation.

- Make use of one of the most popular utility libraries in [Lodash](https://lodash.com/).

## Development

### Javascript Framework

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

### Libraries, extensions and tools

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - JavaScript testing framework to write Unit Tests.
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) - JS utility library.
- [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) - Workflow improvement package to add custom scripts against the repo (in this case, pre-commiting linting and formating)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - A linter tool to standardize code
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatter
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Hosting
